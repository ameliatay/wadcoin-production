It was designed to be independent of any government or central bank, and has a turbulent history as a store of value. It is the earliest virtual currency to meet widespread popularity and success, and is the inspiration of many other cryptocurrencies created in its wake."

Ether, or ETH, is the cryptocurrency used to complete transactions on the blockchain. Ethereum serves as a marketplace for financial services, games, and apps, all of which can be paid for in Ether cryptocurrency and are safe from fraud, theft, or censorship."

Rather than utilising blockchain mining, Ripple uses a consensus mechanism to confirm transactions which make them more energy efficient, faster and cheaper. Ripple ranks among the top 6 most valuable blockchain-based tokens by market capitalization"

Though Litecoin's popularity has waned in recent years, it is ranked the 9th largest cryptocurrency in the world."
